/**
 * play-serve — the HTTP/OpenAPI/MCP/web-UX transport over playing's actions.
 *
 * The four faces are functorial images of the one relating `induceBins` apex: CLI
 * is the `play` dispatcher; this binds the same actions to a node:http server via
 * relating's `serve`, exposing `GET /` (web index), `GET /:verb` (HTML form),
 * `POST /:verb` (body→stdin→stdout), `GET /openapi.json`, and `POST /mcp`. Every
 * POST runs through `dispatch`, so HTTP/MCP/form calls are witnessed as EAVT into
 * playing's own ledger like CLI calls.
