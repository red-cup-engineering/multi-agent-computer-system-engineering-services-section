/**
 * computing — the agent-morphism surface of Eff = Kl(!): computing OVER enriched agents.
 *
 * computing is to the AGENT carrier what communicating is to the meme carrier: every
 * operation admits a full @red-cup-engineering/animating agent (`animating/becoming/doing/working/
 * governing/agent`) — never bare data — and is a carrier→carrier morphism with a
 * declared domain/codomain. It is multi-agent precisely because animating supplies that
 * enriched carrier (cf. communicating's meme, playing's multi-meme designs).
 *
 * The corpus's identity "computation = settling" is taken literally: an agent IS a
 * settled computation (animating settles its perceive→act loop to a glued individual),
 * so `compute` READS the agent's computational truth as one of FOUR rather than running
 * a bare realizer. The Kleisli structure is over agents: `compose` relays two agents
 * into one composite agent (the multiplication), `relay` settles a SOCIETY of agents to
 * its collective knowledge (the ≤_k join — knowing's comonad over the agents). The
 * faculty edges are real: knowing = the ≤_k aggregate (`joinKnowledge`), communicating =
 * the agent's act as a transport (`transport`), playing = the ! exponential witnessing
 * the agent reusable (`bang`). relating is the substrate (marks, FOUR).
