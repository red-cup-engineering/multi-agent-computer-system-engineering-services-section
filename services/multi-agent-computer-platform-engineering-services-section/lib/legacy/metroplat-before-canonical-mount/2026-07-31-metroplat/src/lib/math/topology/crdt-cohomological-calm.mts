 * analysis/crdt-cohomological-calm - finite executable runtime surface.

 * Lean bundles four already-proved convergence readings: H1 vanishing,
 * order-independent CRDT merge, confluence by knowledge join, and quiescence
 * as closure fixed point. This module exposes that finite FOUR/valuation
 * surface and keeps the genuine CALM biconditional as a proof frontier.
