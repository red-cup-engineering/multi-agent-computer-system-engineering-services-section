// FeltOS's faculty seat: the eight faculties are not names here — they are the
// live published packages, mounted. Each package exposes a uniform action
// registry (records with verb, formats, domain/codomain carriers, and a run
// function) built on relating's action machinery over the one metrologic
// bilattice floor. FeltOS's own capability triads name the platform's
// contracted vocabulary; the registries carry the faculties' full verb
// surfaces beneath them.
