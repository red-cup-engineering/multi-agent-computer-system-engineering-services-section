# mash currently exposes only a devShell from its flake — no
# `packages.default` yet because the workspace MSRV is rust 1.86 and
# nixpkgs-unstable's rustc may lag. When that's resolved, add a
# `mash` (or `mash-engine`) app entry here naming the binary the
# parent flake should expose.

# mash — flake contributions

Contribution declaration for mash into a parent polity's Nix flake. Today mash contributes a devShell (Rust toolchain) only. Once the workspace builds reliably under nixpkgs's rustc, add `packages.default` to mash's flake and a `contributes-apps:` entry here so a parent polity can expose `nix run .#mash`.

See the polity's `governance/assets/computing/nix-flake.md` for the schema and the harness migration status.
