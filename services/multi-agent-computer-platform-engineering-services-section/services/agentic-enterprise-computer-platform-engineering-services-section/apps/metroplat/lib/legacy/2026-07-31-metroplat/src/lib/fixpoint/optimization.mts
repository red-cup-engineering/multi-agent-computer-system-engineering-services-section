 *
 * settling/optimization — the optimum IS the settling fixed point.
 *
 * The corpus's received-math `optimization` node says optimization "produces a
 * FIXED POINT … a point where no small change helps", requiring a measure and a
 * constraint. That fixed point is OUR settling / closure fixed point: optimization
 * is the settling dynamics read under a measure-and-constraint gloss. Ported from
 *
 *   * a **measure** = the order `≤_V` of a {@link ValueCategory} (*better = higher*);
 *   * **constraints** = the allowed values of `V` (the system the operator acts within);
 *   * an **improvement** = a monotone, inflationary, idempotent endo on `V` — exactly
 *     a {@link VClosure}. The **optimum** is its fixed point, reached by `settle`.
 *
 * So an `OptimizationProblem` *is* a `ValueCategory` paired with a `VClosure`; its
 * `optimum` is the hub's `settleOverValue`. No solver is hidden here: callers supply
 * the order and lawful improvement closure, and the module returns closure data plus
 * fixed-point / least-fixed-point witnesses. Every law is reused from the
 * value-category settle judgments.
