/**
 * settling/dynamics/substitution/tiling — 2D block substitutions and tile-adjacency graphs.
 *
 * A 1D substitution word is a path (chromatic number 2 always); genuine coloring lives in 2D. A BLOCK
 * substitution sends each symbol to a fixed rectangular block of symbols; inflating a seed `k` times
 * tiles the plane with a level-`k` patch. The TILE-ADJACENCY GRAPH of a patch — a vertex per cell, an
 * edge between neighbouring cells — is the genuine (non-degenerate) graph the coloring readings need:
 * its `chromaticNumber` is the least number of colors with no two adjacent tiles alike, and its
 * proper-coloring space is a factor of the tiling onto a finite palette (the "coloring = factor map to
 * a finite shift = information" reading). The adjacency GEOMETRY drives the chromatic number:
 * orthogonal (4-neighbour, a bipartite grid → 2), triangular (4 + one diagonal → 3), king (8-neighbour
 * memo on coloring aperiodic tiles. Bounded: a finite patch, not the full hull.
