 *
 * settling/bigraded-cohomology — the bigraded refinement of settling cohomology.
 *
 * The paraconsistent settling sheaf splits F^(k) ≅ F^(t) ⊕ F^(⊤): the consistent
 * TRUTH row (m=0) ⊕ the held-CONTRADICTION row (m=1), corresponding to the two adjoint
 * systems of the predication hyperdoctrine (content/…/settling-cohomology/content/
 * bigraded-settling-cohomology/2026-06-18-reference-on-bigraded-settling-cohomology.md). A FOUR cell is placed by
 * its twist-product coordinates ⟨truth, falsity⟩: exactly one evidence side present ↦ the
 * truth row (potential ⟨1,0⟩ / active ⟨0,1⟩, the non-contradictory directions); BOTH sides
 * present ↦ the contradiction row (contested ⟨1,1⟩ = told-both); neither ↦ unknown ⟨0,0⟩
 * (outside the F^(k) non-unknown content).
 *
 * Regime reading: when F^(⊤) = 0 the bigrading collapses to single-graded truth
 * cohomology (H^{1,n} = 0, H^{0,n} = H^n_t). Lean's
 * input data and the strict/Scott collapse reading at the cochain level; the
 * cohomology-level long exact sequence remains a frontier. This Node module implements
 * the executable FOUR-census read: truth row, contradiction row, and collapse
 * witness/obstruction.
 *
 * Pure proof-tree math, sited beside settling/cohomology; faculties parameterize it (a face
 * supplies its own FOUR census or settled charges; the decomposition law lives here).
