/**
 * settling/learning-cycle — observed learning-cycle reads over closure traces.
 *
 * The content-side learning notes read learning as iteration of a monotone,
 * inflationary closure operator: the learner ascends until a fixed point, so a
 * genuine return to an earlier non-fixed state is not a cycle but an
 * obstruction to that learning reading.
 *
 * This module keeps the Node claim smaller and executable. It does not prove an
 * arbitrary JavaScript endomorphism monotone or inflationary. It reads a
 * `ClosureCarrier` already produced by the closure workbench and reports what
 * the recorded finite orbit shows: consecutive ascent, absence or presence of a
 * nontrivial return, the bounded stabilization judgment, and a learning-depth
 * read when the closure search found a regime.
 *
 * The stronger learning-cycle theorem lives in the content and Lean closure
 * ordinal material. This module is the package's executable read: it inspects
 * a finite set, it does not certify arbitrary closure operators.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const closed = closeOrdinalProcess(process);
 * const cycle = learningCycleOfClosureResult(closed);
 *
 * cycle.ascent.kind; // "learning.cycle.observedAscent:witness"
 * cycle.nontrivialReturn.kind; // "learning.cycle.nontrivialReturn:witness"
 * ```
