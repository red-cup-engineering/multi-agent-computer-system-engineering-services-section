//   log → state → record → CONTENT
//
// The fourth projection of the same boundary. Where state/record project the
// whole bulk into one file, content projects a *cut*: each accepted entity of a
// view becomes its own term-addressed document, rendered by a content
// projection (default: markdown with YAML frontmatter, the inverse of the
// markdown codec's `markdownDataform`). The cut is an explicit acceptance
// judgment — a window over the entities of the view — not a hidden filter, in
// the sense of geometry/spatial/cut-and-project. Pure: ./store does the I/O.
