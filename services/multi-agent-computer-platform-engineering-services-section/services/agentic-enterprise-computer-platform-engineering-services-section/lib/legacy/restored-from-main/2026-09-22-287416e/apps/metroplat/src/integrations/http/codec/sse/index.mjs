/**
 * `text/event-stream` representation codecs.
 *
 * Event records encode to SSE frame text through the general event frame, the
 * package's JSON event helper, and comment frames. `parseSseStream` decodes
 * frame text back to event records and normalizes the wire form.
 *
 * This module does not model sinks, hubs, retry loops, heartbeats, or HTTP
 * connection lifecycle. It only models the event-stream representation a server
 * adapter may choose to emit or consume.
